# Hey, I'm Andria 👋
I love building and repairing stuff — apps, games, robots, electric devices (sometimes furniture 😆) and random projects that spark my curiosity... basically everything!
Passionate about designing solutions that simplify what once seemed complicated or even impossible.
Time is limited, but curiosity is endless...
